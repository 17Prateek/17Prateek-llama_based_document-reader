This project allows you to load and split a PDF document into smaller chunks, generate text embeddings using the HuggingFace model, and store the embeddings in ChromaDB. You can then perform a similarity search over the stored chunks to answer queries based on the PDF content.

Features : 
PDF Loading: Load a PDF document from Google Drive.

Text Splitting: Break down the document into manageable chunks for efficient processing.

Embeddings: Generate sentence embeddings using the HuggingFace model.

Vector Store: Store document chunks and their embeddings in ChromaDB.

Question Answering: Perform similarity search to find relevant answers based on user queries.
